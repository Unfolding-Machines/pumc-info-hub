# Oracles

Oracles are a core feature of Plot Unfolding Machine, providing inspiration and answers to your questions as you play. This section summarizes the types of oracles, how to use them, and best practices from the official rulebook.

## What is an Oracle?
An Oracle is a randomizer that helps you answer questions, resolve uncertainty, or generate new ideas. Oracles can be as simple as a yes/no answer or as complex as a full scene prompt.

## Types of Oracles
- **Yes/No Oracles:** Answer binary questions (e.g., “Is the door locked?”)
- **Random Tables:** Provide a list of possible outcomes or inspirations.
- **Decks & Cards:** Draw a card for a random result or event.
- **Scene Prompts:** Suggest what happens next in the story.

## Using Oracles
1. Ask a clear question.
2. Roll or draw from the oracle.
3. Interpret the result in the context of your story.
4. Use the answer to inspire your next scene or decision.

## Example Questions
- Does the guard notice me?
- Is the weather getting worse?
- What is the NPC’s mood?
- What complication arises?

## Tips from the Rulebook
- Oracles are tools for inspiration, not strict rules.
- If an answer doesn’t fit, reinterpret or reroll.
- Use oracles to break creative blocks and add surprise.
