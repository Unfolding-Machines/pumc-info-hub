Random Tables are a powerful way to generate inspiration, events, loot, or answers in your game. PUM makes it easy to create, import, and use random tables for any purpose.

## What are Random Tables?
A random table is a list of possible results. When you roll on the table, you get a random entryâ€”perfect for oracles, encounters, or creative prompts.

## Creating Tables
- Create your own tables in the app, or upload from a `.txt` file.
- Use the `.pumt` format for community-shared tables.
- Find the Random Tables menu in the oracles panel.

## Table Formats & Examples
### Simple Table
```
Result 1
Result 2
Result 3
```

### Weighted Table
```
10|No way!
50|No
90|Yes
100|Extreme yes!
```

### Nested Table
```
Roll in Weapons table: {{Weapons}} and in Armors table {{Armors}}
```

### Weighted & Nested Table
```
10|No way! also {{Side effect}}
50|No
90|Yes
100|Extreme yes! also {{Side effect}}
```

## Tips
- Share your tables with the community!
- Use tables for anything: NPCs, locations, plot twists, treasures, and more.
- Download and remix tables from other players.
