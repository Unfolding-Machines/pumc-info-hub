# Markdown Text Styling

You can style your text in the log area and entities editor using Markdown. This makes your notes, logs, and entries clear, beautiful, and easy to read.

## Headers
Use the hash symbol (`#`) followed by a space. The number of hashes determines the size:

```
# Large Header
## Medium Header
### Small Header
```

## Formatting
- *Italic*: `*italic*`
- **Bold**: `**bold**`

## Lists
- Unordered: `- Item`
- Ordered: `1. Item`

## Code
- Inline code: `` `code` ``
- Code block:
  ```
  line 1
  line 2
  ```

## Tips
- Use Markdown to organize your logs and notes.
- The entities editor has a toolbar for easy formatting.
- Experiment with different styles to make your story shine!
