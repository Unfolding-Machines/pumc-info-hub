## Plot Tracks, Plot Nodes, and Plot Focus

### Plot Tracks
Plot Tracks are the backbone of your story’s structure in PUM. They help you organize your adventure into meaningful sections and keep your narrative moving forward.

**What is a Plot Track?**
A Plot Track is a sequence of Plot Beats—important moments or scenes that advance your story. Think of it as a roadmap for your adventure, from beginning to end.

**Plot Scope:** Before you create a Plot Track, define your Plot Scope. Is your story a full campaign, a short quest, or a single dramatic episode? The scope helps you decide how long and detailed your Plot Track should be.

**Types of Plot Tracks:**
- Standard: A generic structure for most games. Great for beginners and short stories.
- Improvised: Build your track as you go. Perfect for freeform or evolving stories.
- Escalating: For stories that ramp up in intensity and challenge.
- Dungeon: Structured for exploration and discovery.
- Journey: Focused on travel, quests, and progression.
- Heroic: Spotlight on protagonists and their personal arcs.
- Survival: Emphasizes danger, resource management, and overcoming adversity.
- Crisis: Episodic, problem-focused adventures.
- Drama: For introspective, character-driven stories.

You can edit, expand, or rename sections of your Plot Track at any time. For improvised games, add new beats as inspiration strikes!

**Advancing the Plot:**
You move forward on the Plot Track by playing Plot Beats. These can be:
- Random Prompts: Let PUM suggest what happens next.
- Modified Proposals: Propose your own scene, then let PUM add a twist.

Each Plot Beat can be a scene, event, or turning point. Use them to mark progress, celebrate victories, or introduce complications.

**Tips for Using Plot Tracks:**
- Don’t be afraid to skip, repeat, or change beats as your story evolves.
- Use the Plot Track as a guide, not a constraint.
- Mark your track as finished when your story concludes, or keep playing for epilogues and bonus scenes.

### Plot Nodes
Plot Nodes are the essential elements that make up your story’s universe. They are the people, places, problems, discoveries, and mysteries that drive your narrative forward.

**What are Plot Nodes?**
Plot Nodes are flexible, freeform entries you create to represent:
- Game or World Elements: Key features that define your setting (e.g., ancient ruins, oppressive government, magical storms).
- Potential Obstacles: Dangers, challenges, or enemies (e.g., rival factions, natural disasters, inner fears).
- Useful Findings: Discoveries that help the protagonists (e.g., secret maps, powerful artifacts, hidden allies).
- Pending Questions: Mysteries or unresolved issues (e.g., Who betrayed the rebellion? What lies beyond the forbidden zone?).
- Relevant Characters & Interesting Locations: Important NPCs and places that shape your story.

**How to Use Plot Nodes:**
- Add, edit, or remove nodes as your story evolves.
- Use them for inspiration, not limitation—leave them vague or detailed as you like.
- Random Prompts may invoke Plot Nodes for unexpected twists.
- Keep your list updated to reflect the current state of your story.

**Examples:**
- Game Element: "A city ruled by sentient machines."
- Obstacle: "A deadly sandstorm blocks the only road."
- Finding: "A diary revealing the villain’s true motive."
- Question: "Why are the stars disappearing?"
- Character: "Captain Mira, the exiled leader."

**Tips:**
- You can mark characters and locations as Plot Nodes to have them show up in random prompts.
- Don’t worry about perfection—Plot Nodes are meant to evolve!

### Plot Focus
Plot Focus is a powerful setting in PUM that lets you control how much your story relies on your own Plot Nodes versus random events. It’s your way to tune the balance between structure and surprise.

**What is Plot Focus?**
Plot Focus determines how often Random Prompts (plot beats) will invoke your Plot Nodes compared to unrelated random events. This allows you to customize the feel of your game:
- Balanced: Equal chance for plot nodes and random events.
- Story Driven: Only your plot nodes are used—great for prepared or prewritten adventures.
- Encounters: Focus on dangers, enemies, and challenges.
- Social: Brings characters and social events to the forefront.
- Exploration: Emphasizes locations and the unknown.
- World: Focuses on world-building and universe elements.
- Treasure: Highlights discoveries and useful findings.
- Improvised: Only random events, plot nodes for your own guidance.

**Choosing a Plot Focus:**
- Use Story Driven for tightly planned stories.
- Use Improvised for maximum unpredictability.
- Balanced is a great starting point for most games.
- Switch focus as your story evolves!

**Example Scenarios:**
- Dungeon Crawl: Use Encounters or Exploration focus.
- Political Drama: Try Social or Story Driven.
- Treasure Hunt: Treasure focus brings more discoveries.

**Tips:**
- You can change Plot Focus at any time.
- Experiment to find what works best for your play style.
