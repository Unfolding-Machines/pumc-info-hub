# Game Concepts

This section explains the core concepts and terminology of Plot Unfolding Machine, as described in the official rulebook.

## Plot Beat
A Plot Beat is a significant moment or event in your story. It can be a scene, a twist, or a turning point. Plot Beats are how you advance along the [Plot Track](plot-tracks.md).

## Oracle
An Oracle is a tool for answering questions and generating inspiration. Oracles can be simple (yes/no), complex ([Random Tables](../random-tables.md)), or narrative ([Oracles](oracles.md)). Learn more in the [Oracles](oracles.md) section.

## Scene
A Scene is a narrative unitâ€”an event, conversation, or action sequence. Scenes are often created or changed by Plot Beats.

## Plot Track
A Plot Track is the structure of your story, divided into beats. It helps you organize your adventure and see your progress. See the [Plot Tracks](plot-tracks.md) page for details.

## Plot Node
Plot Nodes are the building blocks of your story: world elements, obstacles, findings, questions, characters, and locations. See the [Plot Nodes](plot-nodes.md) page for more.

## Random Prompt
A Random Prompt is a suggestion from the app for what could happen next. It can invoke plot nodes or random events. See [Random Tables](../random-tables.md) for inspiration.

## Modified Proposal
A Modified Proposal is when you suggest a scene, and the app adds a twist or change. See the [Plot Tracks](plot-tracks.md) page for usage.

## Entities
Entities are characters, locations, and compendiums (in PUM Companion)
